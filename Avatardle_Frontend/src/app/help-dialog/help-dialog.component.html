            <h2>Categories</h2>

            <div style="margin-left:1rem;">
                <h3>Gender</h3>
                <p>Most characters fall under male or female, other entities like spirits that don't have a gender
                    would be denoted with none.</p>

                <h3>Nationality</h3>
                <p>This refers to where a character originates. Keep in mind that sometimes the place of origin may
                    not be a clearly defined nation (like the spirit world) so they would be denoted with none. </p>

                <h3>Bending Element</h3>
                <p>This only includes the 4 basic bending elements: Water, Earth, Fire, and Air.</p>

                <h3>Affiliations</h3>
                <p>Affiliations refer to traits or charateristics that relate to the character. Every character
                    has at least 1 affiliation. Regardless of how many afflliations
                    the character has, only a maximum of 3 affiliations are shown per character. If a character has
                    more than 3 affiliations, 3 affiliations will be chosen at random from their pool.
                </p>
                <p>Note about the color indicators: 0 matching affiliations = Incorrect, 1-2 matching affiliations = Partially Correct, 
                    3 matching affiliations = Correct
                </p>

                <h3>First Appearance</h3>
                <p>This refers to the name of first episode that the character appears in. In addition, there is an
                    arrow indicator that states whether the first appearance of the target character
                    takes place before or after the current episode. The upwards arrow <span
                        style="color:lightblue; font-size: large;">‚¨Ü</span> means the target episode
                    takes place after and the downwards arrow <span style="color:lightblue; font-size: large;">‚¨á</span>
                    means it takes place before.
